# Code Formating
- Your code formatting must be consistent with the rest of the code base
  - Use `Tab` characters to indent your code, not spaces. Indent size is 1 Tab = 4 spaces
  - Preferred casing is UpperCamelCase for function names, and lowerCamelCase for variable and argument names
    - ```var myResult = myObject.MyMethod( myArgument )```
- Your code must have comments. Others should be able to understand the purpose of your functions, classes, enums, etc.
- Do not add unnecessary changes to your code - do not "fix" white space or remove comments. Please note that GitHub may randomly add and/or remove whitespace, that is fine and is not agaisnt these guidelines.
  - Try to keep your diffs as simple as possible, it makes your code easier to review
